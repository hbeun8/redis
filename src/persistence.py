'''
We have two options for persistence:
    1. snapshotting
    2. append-only file (fn) -> opens the file and logs the command to the file.

AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server.
These operations can then be replayed again at server startup,
reconstructing the original dataset. Commands are logged using the
same format as the Redis protocol itself.

Consider fsync policy to speed it up.
